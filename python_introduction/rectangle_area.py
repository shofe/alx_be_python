# Defining the variables
print(f"length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.")
print(f"width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.")

# Assigning numbers to the variables
length = 10
width = 5

# The formula for area of a rectangle is:"
area = length * width

# The output
