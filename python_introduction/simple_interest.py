# Values given
principal =1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3

# Here is the formula for the calculation.
Interest = principal * rate * time

# printing the values giving in words
print(f"For Principal = {principal} , Rate = {rate}, and Time = {time},")
#The final answer
print(f"The simple iinterest is {float(Interest)}")
